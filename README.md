## **Project Overview** 

The **replication_code.Rmd** is an R Markdown file designed to produce a PDF document in correspondence with the manuscript **"Upzoning and Residential Transaction Price in Nashville"** by Nicholas Forster-Benson. It compares residential sale prices of upzoned parcels -part of Nashvilleâ€™s 2010 â€˜Downtown Codeâ€™ (DTC) upzoning- with various control boundaries (1k, 3k, 5k, and 10k). This is achieved using both Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Matching models.

The manuscript relies on data from several Excel files, statistical analysis, and graphical presentation to present insights on treatment effects on housing prices.

 
## **File Structure (R Markdown)**

  - **Header**: YAML metadata for title, output format (PDF), and the current date.
  - **Setup Chunk**: Loads required R libraries and sets global options.
  - **Descriptive Statistics and Data Visualization**: Imports data, processes it, and visualizes it using `ggplot2`.
  - **DiD Regression Models**: Runs multiple linear models to estimate treatment effects.
  - **Matching Methods**: Applies matching techniques to enhance the covariate similarities of treated and non-treated parcels.
  - **Quantile DiD**: Applies weights to different ranges of the distribution to estimate the effects across different market segments.

 ## **Data Sources**

All files contain a data on all residential parcel sales netween 2000 and 2023 in Nashville/Davidson county, with differing control boundry sizes. Data files are stored in a subfolder named `data/`.

 1. **1km_Boundary.csv**: Data for treatment and 1km control group.
 2. **3km_Boundary.csv**: Data for treatment and 3km control group.
 3. **5km_Boundary.csv**: Data for treatment and 5km control group.
 4. **10km_Boundary.csv**: Data for treatment and 10km control group.
 5. **Full_Control.csv**: Data for treatment and all of Davidson county control group.






## **Variable Descriptions**
 
 Below is a description of the key variables used in the analysis:
 
 -	SalePrice: The transaction price of the property was sold.
 -	CoreBin: A binary variable indicating if the property was treated (part of the 2010 upzoning â€˜Downtown Code.â€™
 -	TimeBin: A binary variable representing if the sale was before or after the treatment (February 2010).
 - FinishArea: The total finished square footage of the property.
 -	Acres: The size of the property lot, measured in acres.
 -	PropZip: The zip code of the property, identifying its general location within a larger geographic area.
 -	Tract: The census tract of the property was sold.
 -	Quarter: The quarter of the year (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) in which the property sale took place.
 - Year: The year in which the property sale occurred.
 
## **Required Libraries**

 - `stargazer`: For generating model output tables.
 - `AER`: For regression analysis.
 - `ggplot2`: For data visualization.
 - `plm`: For panel data analysis.
 - `dplyr`: For data manipulation.
 - `tidyverse`: Collection of data analysis packages.
 - `qte`: For quantile treatment effects.
 - `fixes`: For event study visualization.

## **Usage Instructions**
 
 1. Load R Markdown File: Open the `2024_Manuscript.Rmd` file in RStudio.
 2. Data Setup: Ensure that the Excel files are located in the `data/` folder as specified.
 3. Run the File: Click the "Knit" button to generate the PDF report.
  
## **Troubleshooting**

 - Error: File Not Found: Ensure that the `data/` folder contains all required Excel files.
 - Missing Packages: Run `install.packages("package_name")` for any missing R packages.
 - Model Errors: Verify that the columns in the Excel files match those referenced in the code.
  
## **Notes & Assumptions**

 1. Data Integrity: Ensure that Excel files in the `data/` folder are formatted correctly and column names match the script.
 2. Year Range: The analysis covers data from 2000 to 2023.
 3. Outlier Removal: Sale prices above $2.5M or below $1 are excluded from the analysis.
