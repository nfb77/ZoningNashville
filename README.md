## **Project Overview** 

The **replication_code.Rmd** is an R Markdown file designed to produce a PDF document in correspondence with the manuscript <a href="https://nfb77.github.io/Files/URTPN.pdf" target="_blank">"Upzoning and Residential Transaction Price in Nashville"</a> by Nicholas Forster-Benson and Karim Nchare. It compares residential sale prices of upzoned parcels -part of Nashvilleâ€™s 2010 â€˜Downtown Codeâ€™ (DTC) upzoning- with various geographic control boundaries as well as synthetic controls created through matching methods. This is achieved using both Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Quantile Difference-in-Dofferences (QDiD).

The manuscript relies on data from .CSV files, statistical analysis, and graphical presentation to present insights on treatment effects on housing prices.

 
## **File Structure (R Markdown)**

- **Header**: YAML metadata for title, output format (PDF), and the current date.
- **Setup Chunk**: Loads required R libraries and sets global options.

- **Data Visualization and Descriptive Statistics**:  
  - Produces log of price by treatment figures using both geographic and matched controls.  
  - Includes a pre-treatment placebo analysis with both matching (PSM) and geographic (3km) controls.  
  - Summarizes key variables using descriptive statistics.

- **Covariate Balance Tables**:  
  - Presents balance diagnostics for covariates using both geographic and matched samples.

- **Event Studies**:  
  - Constructs two-way fixed effects (TWFE) event studies with sequential treatment timing.  
  - Estimates dynamic treatment effects using both geographic and matched controls.

- **Estimating Average Treatment Effects (ATE)**:  
  - Implements DiD regressions for log sale price and price per square foot using both geographic and matched controls.  
  - Includes temporally segmented DiD models for two periods (2010â€“2015, 2016â€“2023) across both sample types.

- **Quantile Treatment Effects (QTE)**:  
  - Estimates distributional treatment effects using quantile DiD (Q-DiD) approaches.  
  - Applies the method with both geographic and matched samples to assess heterogeneity in impacts.

 ## **Data Sources**

All files contain a data on all residential parcel sales netween 2000 and 2023 in Nashville/Davidson county, with differing control boundry sizes. Data files are stored in a subfolder named `data/`.

 1. **1km_Boundary.csv**: Data for treatment and 1km control group.
 2. **3km_Boundary.csv**: Data for treatment and 3km control group.
 3. **5km_Boundary.csv**: Data for treatment and 5km control group.
 4. **10km_Boundary.csv**: Data for treatment and 10km control group.
 5. **Full_Control.csv**: Data for treatment and all of Davidson county control group.






## **Variable Descriptions**
 
 Below is a description of the key variables used in the analysis:
 
 -	SalePrice: The transaction price of the property was sold.
 -	PricePerSqrft: Represents the price per square foot of a parcel.
 -	CoreBin: A binary variable indicating if the property was treated (part of the 2010 upzoning â€˜Downtown Code.â€™
 -	TimeBin: A binary variable representing if the sale was before or after the treatment (February 2010).
 - FinishArea: The total finished square footage of the property.
 -	Acres: The size of the property lot, measured in acres.
 -	PropZip: The zip code of the property, identifying its general location within a larger geographic area.
 -	Tract: The census tract of the property was sold.
 -	Quarter: The quarter of the year (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) in which the property sale took place.
 - Year: The year in which the property sale occurred.

## **Usage Instructions**
 
 1. Load R Markdown File: Open the `replication_code.Rmd` file in RStudio.
 2. Data Setup: Ensure that the Excel files are located in the `data/` folder as specified.
 3. Run the File: Click the "Knit" button to generate the PDF report, providing all tables and visualization presented in manuscript.
  
## **Troubleshooting**

 - Error: File Not Found: Ensure that the `data/` folder contains all required Excel files.
 - Missing Packages: Run `install.packages("package_name")` for any missing R packages.
 - Model Errors: Verify that the columns in the .CSV match those referenced in the code.
  
## **Notes & Assumptions**

 1. Data Integrity: Ensure that .CSV files in the `data/` folder are formatted correctly and column names match the script.
 2. Year Range: The analysis covers data from 2000 to 2023.
 3. Outlier Removal: Sale prices above $2.5M or below $1 are excluded from the analysis.
